# nigeria-id-validator
Nigeria-focused ID validation demo using checksum algorithms
# 🇳🇬 Nigeria ID Validator (Demo Project)

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how **checksum algorithms** (specifically the Luhn algorithm) can be used to reduce data-entry errors in national-scale identification or service systems in Nigeria.

## Why This Project
Many digital systems fail due to simple human input errors.  
This project shows how basic validation improves reliability — while also explaining why validation alone is **not security**.

## Scope
- Structured Nigeria-focused ID format
- Checksum validation using Luhn
- Clear discussion of security limitations

> ⚠️ This is a demo project, not an official government system.
